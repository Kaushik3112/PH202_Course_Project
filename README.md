 The near-field Radiative Heat Transfer between to semi infinite $\alpha - MoO_3$ biaxial crystals is studied numerically using the fluctuation dissipation theorem combined with modified 4$\times$4 transfer matrix method.It is found that the maximum heat flux is along the [001] direction, which can be explained by the existence of hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPPs) inside $\alpha-MoO_3$ and excitation of
hyperbolic surface phonon polaritons (HSPhPs) at the vacuum/$\alpha-MoO_3$ interfaces.We also the study the effect of relative rotation between the two $\alpha - MoO_3$ crystals, we notice that the modulation contrast can be as high as two. This is attributed to the misalignment of HSPhPS and HPPs of the emitter and receiver.
